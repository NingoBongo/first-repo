        types of HTML elements. There are several other ways of selecting elements to apply styles too, though. If the selector is an HTML element, you can just type the name of the element. If it is a class name, it should be preceded by a period. If it's an ID name, it should be preceded by a pound sign or hash mark. So let's make just one of our paragraphs have purple text. Add a class of purple text to our paragraph element. And our style element will add a color equals purple rule that applies to the purple text class.

        So you can see here, in our P element, we've typed "class=purple-text" in quotation marks. And then up in our style element, we have added a .purple-text selector with a color and a purple value in the curly bracket marks. So classes are a great way to share styles among several elements. With our new purple text class, we can change the font color of any HTML element it is applied to. Classes should always be pretty generic and are meant to be shared styles, rather than just single styles. Let's define a new style rule. The selector will be for a class called "important." And the rule will be "font weight bold." Add a second paragraph element to the body, and give it the class name of "important."

        OK. So again, I added the .important selector with a font weight of bold in the style element. And in the new paragraph I've created down here, we have a "class=important" in quotation marks. And then the paragraph I've typed, "No, really, the world is not filled with hopelessness and despair. I promise." So now, let us also, with this paragraph, add the class of purple text because there is no limit to the number of classes that any particular element can have.
